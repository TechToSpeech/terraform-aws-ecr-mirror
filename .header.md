# Terraform Module: AWS ECR Mirror

A Terraform module that performs a local docker pull and push to a given AWS ECR repository

## Use Case
In late 2020, Docker Hub announced that the Hub service would begin limiting the rate at which images can be pulled under their anonymous and free plans. 

The [AWS recommendation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/advice-for-customers-dealing-with-docker-hub-rate-limits-and-a-coming-soon-announcement/) for those not wishing to upgrade to a paid plan is to mirror the Dockerhub image to their own AWS ECR repository. 

This simple task requires a basic 'pull from Dockerhub-push to ECR' loop for which there exists no simple bootstrapping solution. The typical use case is a new ECR repository that would look to use a Dockerhub image as its 'base' image which can then be used in subsequent builds without the pull limits. 

This module is a simple terraform `local-exec` provisioner which runs the required awscli and docker push commands to ECR, and can be woven in to your existing set-up. 

## Requirements

- aws-cli v2 installed and configured with a named [profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) that has permissions to push to the desired ECR repository
- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on the machine executing terraform, and permissions for the user executing terraform to run docker commands (e.g. by adding the user to the 'docker' user group)
- Experimental mode enabled if you wish to use `architecture` argument. See [Leverage multi-CPU architecture support](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/) in Docker documentation. 

## Idempotence

As this module is essentially running a series of bash commands, it ensures idempotence by triggering only when any of the values of the `docker_source`, `ecr_repo_name` or `ecr_repo_tag` variables are changed.

## Usage Example

```
module "ecr_mirror" {
  source  = "TechToSpeech/ecr-mirror/aws"
  version = "0.0.8"
  architecture = "linux/arm64/v8"
  aws_account_id = "123456544225"
  aws_region = "eu-west-1"
  docker_source = "wordpress:php7.4-apache"
  aws_profile = "default"
  ecr_repo_name = "php_wordpress"
  ecr_repo_tag = "base"
}
```

Consider adding an additional `depends_on` attribute if you are using this module in combination with a Terraform resource that also creates the ECR repository being pushed to.
